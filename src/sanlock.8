[COMMAND] [ACTION] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION

The sanlock daemon manages leases for applications running on a cluster of
hosts with shared storage.  All lease management and coordination is done
through reading and writing blocks on the shared storage.  Two types of
leases are used, each based on a different algorithm:

"delta leases" are slow to acquire and require regular i/o to shared
storage.  A delta lease exists in a single sector of storage.  Acquiring a
delta lease involves reads and writes to that sector separated by specific
delays.  Once acquired, a lease must be renewed by updating a timestamp in
the sector regularly.  sanlock uses a delta lease internally to hold a
lease on a host_id.  host_id leases prevent two hosts from using the same
host_id and provide basic host liveness information based on the renewals.

"paxos leases" are generally fast to acquire and sanlock makes them
available to applications as general purpose resource leases.  A paxos
lease exists in 1MB of shared storage (8MB for 4k sectors).  Acquiring a
paxos lease involves reads and writes to max_hosts (2000) sectors in a
specific sequence specified by the Disk Paxos algorithm.  paxos leases use
host_id's internally to indicate the owner of the lease, and the algorithm
fails if different hosts use the same host_id.  So, delta leases provide
the unique host_id's used in paxos leases.  paxos leases also refer to
delta leases to check if a host_id is alive.

Before sanlock can be used, the user must assign each host a host_id,
which is a number between 1 and 2000.  Two hosts should not be given the
same host_id (even though delta leases attempt to detect this mistake.)

sanlock views a pool of storage as a "lockspace".  Each distinct pool of
storage, e.g. from different sources, would typically be defined as a
separate lockspace, with a unique lockspace name.

Part of this storage space must be reserved and initialized for sanlock to
store delta leases.  Each host that wants to use the lockspace must first
acquire a delta lease on its host_id number within the lockspace.  (See
the add_lockspace action/api.)  The space required for 2000 delta leases
in the lockspace (for 2000 possible host_id's) is 1MB (8MB for 4k
sectors).  (This is the same size required for a single paxos lease.)

More storage space must be reserved and initialized for paxos leases,
according to the needs of the applications using sanlock.

The following steps illustrate these concepts using the command line.
Applications may choose to do these same steps through libsanlock.

1. Create storage pools and reserve and initialize host_id leases
.br
two different LUNs on a SAN: /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc
.br
# vgcreate pool1 /dev/sdb
.br
# vgcreate pool2 /dev/sdc
.br
# lvcreate -n hostid_leases -L 1MB pool1
.br
# lvcreate -n hostid_leases -L 1MB pool2
.br
# sanlock direct init -s LS1:0:/dev/pool1/hostid_leases:0
.br
# sanlock direct init -s LS2:0:/dev/pool2/hostid_leases:0
.br

2. Start the sanlock daemon on each host
.br
# sanlock daemon
.br

3. Add each lockspace to be used
.br
host1:
.br
# sanlock client add_lockspace -s LS1:1:/dev/pool1/hostid_leases:0
.br
# sanlock client add_lockspace -s LS2:1:/dev/pool2/hostid_leases:0
.br
host2:
.br
# sanlock client add_lockspace -s LS1:2:/dev/pool1/hostid_leases:0
.br
# sanlock client add_lockspace -s LS2:2:/dev/pool2/hostid_leases:0
.br

4. Applications can now reserve/initialize space for resource leases, and
then acquire the leases as they need to access the resources.

The resource leases that are created and how they are used depends on the
application.  For example, say application A, running on host1 and host2,
needs to synchronize access to data it stores on /dev/pool1/Adata.  A
could use a resource lease as follows:

5. Reserve and initialize a single resource lease for Adata
.br
# lvcreate -n Adata_lease -L 1MB pool1
.br
# sanlock direct init -r LS1:Adata:/dev/pool1/Adata_lease:0
.br

6. Acquire the lease from the app using libsanlock (see sanlock_register,
sanlock_acquire).  If the app is already running as pid 123, and has
registered with the sanlock daemon, the lease can be added for it
manually.
.br
# sanlock client acquire -r LS1:Adata:/dev/pool1/Adata_lease:0 -p 123
.br

.B offsets

offsets must be 1MB aligned for disks with 512 byte sectors, and
8MB aligned for disks with 4096 byte sectors.

offsets may be used to place leases on the same device rather than using
separate devices and offset 0 as shown in examples above, e.g. these
commands above:
.br
# sanlock direct init -s LS1:0:/dev/pool1/hostid_leases:0
.br
# sanlock direct init -r LS1:Adata:/dev/pool1/Adata_lease:0
.br
could be replaced by:
.br
.br
# sanlock direct init -s LS1:0:/dev/pool1/leases:0
.br
# sanlock direct init -r LS1:Adata:/dev/pool1/leases:1048576

.B failures

If a process holding resource leases fails or exits without releasing its
leases, sanlock will release the leases for it automatically.

If the sanlock daemon cannot renew a lockspace host_id for a specific
period of time (usually because storage access is lost), sanlock will kill
any process holding a resource lease within the lockspace.

If the sanlock daemon crashes or gets stuck, it will no longer renew the
expiry time of its per-host_id connections to the wdmd daemon, and the
watchdog device will reset the host.

.B watchdog

sanlock uses the
.BR wdmd (8)
daemon to access /dev/watchdog.  A separate wdmd connection is maintained
with wdmd for each host_id being renewed.  Each host_id connection has an
expiry time for some seconds in the future.  After each successful host_id
renewal, sanlock updates the associated expiry time in wdmd.  If wdmd
finds any connection expired, it will not pet /dev/watchdog.  After enough
successive expired/failed checks, the watchdog device will fire and reset
the host.

After a number of failed attempts to renew a host_id, sanlock kills any
process using that lockspace.  Once all those processes have exited,
sanlock will unregister the associated wdmd connection.  wdmd will no
longer find the expired connection, and will resume petting /dev/watchdog
(assuming it finds no other failed/expired tests.)  If the killed
processes did not exit quickly enough, the expired wdmd connection will
not be unregistered, and /dev/watchdog will reset the host.

Based on these known timeout values, sanlock on another host can
calculate, based on the last host_id renewal, when the failed host will
have been reset by its watchdog (or killed all the necessary processes).

If the sanlock daemon itself fails, crashes, get stuck, it will no longer
update the expiry time for its host_id connections to wdmd, which will
also lead to the watchdog resetting the host.

.B safety

sanlock leases are meant to guarantee that two process on two hosts are
never allowed to hold the same resource lease at once.  If they were, the
resource being protected may be corrupted.  There are three levels of
protection built into sanlock itself:

1. The paxos leases and delta leases themselves.

2. If the leases cannot function because storage access is lost (host_id's
cannot be renewed), the sanlock daemon kills any pids using resource
leases in the lockspace.

3. If the pids do not exit after being killed, or if the sanlock daemon
fails, the watchdog device resets the host.

Tell the sanlock daemon to report the required lease alignment for a storage
path.  Only path is used from the LOCKSPACE argument.

.BR "sanlock client add_lockspace -s" " LOCKSPACE"

Tell the sanlock daemon to acquire the specified host_id in the lockspace.
This will allow resources to be acquired in the lockspace.

Tell the sanlock daemon to release the specified host_id in the lockspace.
Any processes holding resource leases in this lockspace will be killed,
and the resource leases not released.

.BR "sanlock client command -r" " RESOURCE " \
\fB-c\fP " " \fIpath\fP " " \fIargs\fP

Register with the sanlock daemon, acquire the specified resource lease,
and exec the command at path with args.  When the command exits, the
sanlock daemon will release the lease.  -c must be the final option.

\fB-p\fP " " \fIpid\fP

Tell the sanlock daemon to acquire or release the specified resource lease
for the given pid.  The pid must be registered with the sanlock daemon.
acquire can optionally take a versioned RESOURCE string RESOURCE:lver,
where lver is the version of the lease that must be acquired, or fail.

.BI "sanlock client inquire -p" " pid"

Print the resource leases held the given pid.  The format is a versioned
RESOURCE string "RESOURCE:lver" where lver is the version of the lease
held.

.BR "sanlock client request -r" " RESOURCE " \
\fB-f\fP " " \fIforce_mode\fP

Request the owner of a resource do something specified by force_mode.  A
versioned RESOURCE:lver string must be used with a greater version than is
presently held.  Zero lver and force_mode clears the request.

.BR "sanlock client examine -r" " RESOURCE"

Examine the request record for the currently held resource lease and carry
out the action specified by the requested force_mode.

.BR "sanlock client examine -s" " LOCKSPACE"

Examine requests for all resource leases currently held in the named
lockspace.  Only lockspace_name is used from the LOCKSPACE argument.

.BR \-a " 0|1"
use async i/o

.BI -o " sec"
io timeout in seconds

.BR "sanlock direct init -s" " LOCKSPACE"
.br
.BR "sanlock direct init -r" " RESOURCE"

Initialize storage for 2000 host_id (delta) leases for the given
lockspace, or initialize storage for one resource (paxos) lease.  Both
options require 1MB of space.  The host_id in the LOCKSPACE string is not
relevant to initialization, so the value is ignored.  (The default of 2000
host_ids can be changed for special cases using the -n num_hosts and -m
max_hosts options.)

.BR "sanlock direct read_leader -s" " LOCKSPACE"
.br
.BR "sanlock direct read_leader -r" " RESOURCE"

Read a leader record from disk and print the fields.  The leader record is
the single sector of a delta lease, or the first sector of a paxos lease.

.BR "sanlock direct read_id -s" " LOCKSPACE"
.br
.BR "sanlock direct live_id -s" " LOCKSPACE"

read_id reads a host_id and prints the owner.  live_id reads a host_id
once a second until it the timestamp or owner change (prints live 1), or
until host_dead_seconds (prints live 0).  (host_dead_seconds is derived
from the io_timeout option.  The live 0|1 conclusion will not match the
sanlock daemon's conclusion unless the configured timeouts match.)

.SH USAGE

.SS Request/Examine

The first part of making a request for a resource is writing the request
record of the resource (the sector following the leader record).  To make
a successful request:
.IP \(bu 3
RESOURCE:lver must be greater than the lver presently held by the other
host.  This implies the leader record must be read to discover the lver,
prior to making a request.
.IP \(bu 3
RESOURCE:lver must be greater than or equal to the lver presently
written to the request record.  Two hosts may write a new request at the
same time for the same lver, in which case both would succeed, but the
force_mode from the last would win.
.IP \(bu 3
The force_mode must be greater than zero.
.IP \(bu 3
To unconditionally clear the request record (set both lver and
force_mode to 0), make request with RESOURCE:0 and force_mode 0.
.PP

The owner of the requested resource will not know of the request unless it
is explicitly told to examine its resources via the "examine" api/command,
or otherwise notfied.

The second part of making a request is notifying the resource lease owner
that it should examine the request records of its resource leases.  The
notification will cause the lease owner to automatically run the
equivalent of "sanlock client examine -s LOCKSPACE" for the lockspace of
the requested resource.

The notification is made using a bitmap in each host_id delta lease.  Each
bit represents each of the possible host_ids (1-2000).  If host A wants to
notify host B to examine its resources, A sets the bit in its own bitmap
that corresponds to the host_id of B.  When B next renews its delta lease,
it reads the delta leases for all hosts and checks each bitmap to see if
its own host_id has been set.  It finds the bit for its own host_id set in
A's bitmap, and examines its resource request records.  (The bit remains
set in A's bitmap for request_finish_seconds.)

\fIforce_mode\fP determines the action the resource lease owner should
take:

\fB1\fP (KILL_PID): kill the process holding the resource lease.  When the
process has exited, the resource lease will be released, and can then be
acquired by anyone.
